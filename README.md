2. **Right-click â†’ "Add Annotation"** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+A`)
3. **Enter your note** in the input box
4. **Choose a color** to visually distinguish the annotation (8 colors available)
5. **Select tags** (optional) to categorize the annotation
6. **View in sidebar** with all annotations organized by file
7. **Export as Markdown** to share with your team or paste into AI chats
