# Annotative

**Simple, powerful code annotation for your IDE. Perfect for reviewing AI-generated code, collaborating on pull requests, and documenting your work.**

Select code, add notes with optional tags, and export as Markdown. Stay organized without leaving your editor.

4. **View in sidebar** with all annotations organized by file
5. **Export as Markdown** to share with your team or paste into AI chats
