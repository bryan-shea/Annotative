# Annotative

**Simple, powerful code annotation for your IDE. Perfect for reviewing AI-generated code, collaborating on pull requests, and documenting your work.**

Select code, add notes with optional tags, and export as Markdown. Stay organized without leaving your editor.

## Use Cases

- **Review AI-generated code** from Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, or other models
- **Code reviews** and collaborative feedback on pull requests
- **Note-taking** and quick documentation while coding
- **Self-review** and quality checks before committing
- **Team collaboration** with exportable feedback
- **Learning** by annotating code systematically

## How It Works

1. **Select code** you want to annotate
2. **Right-click â†’ "Add Annotation"** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+A`)
3. **Add your note** and optionally tag it (bug, performance, security, style, improvement, docs, question)
4. **View in sidebar** with all annotations organized by file
5. **Export as Markdown** to share with your team or paste into AI chats
